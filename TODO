*** CORE ***

* scuse: generated fuse --> buf should be Pointer in def write()
* combinator parser for C header files -> generate scala glue
* convert to sbt (scalify too!)
* capabilities? look at E again
* scala compiler: use fuse mount to play games with classfiles

*** FSes ***

* mboxfs
* unionfs - treat many dirs as one
* make loopbacfsk naturally extensible
* gitfs: given bare repo, mount checks it out and issues a commit for every write (see waybackfs)
* filterfs: apply arbitrary byte[] -> byte[] and cpath -> cpath filters
* xmlfs:  XML filesystem and DOM filesystem
* jar finding filesystem: sees attempt to open /.../foo.jar and gets it  http://www.jarfinder.com/
* strongly typed filesystem?
* structured data in pipes?
* launchdfs
* sqlitefs
